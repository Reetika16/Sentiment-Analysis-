# Sentiment-Analysis
Welcome to our GitHub repository for the "Text-Based Sentiment Analysis of Twitter Dataset Using Random Forest and TF-IDF" project! In this project, we explore the sentiment expressed in tweets using machine learning techniques. Leveraging Random Forest classification along with TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization, we aim to accurately classify tweets into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. Our approach involves preprocessing the Twitter dataset, extracting features using TF-IDF, and training a Random Forest model to predict sentiment labels. Through this repository, you'll find the necessary code, datasets, and to build this project.
## IMPORTANT NOTE ##
Please ensure to perform all the necessary steps of data cleaning, preprocessing, and model building within a Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab environment. This includes tasks such as text preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation. Once the model is trained and evaluated satisfactorily, save it as a pickle file (*.pkl) using Python's pickle module or joblib library. This pickle model file will be utilized in the app.py file for sentiment analysis. By following this approach, we maintain consistency and reproducibility, ensuring that the model used in the application accurately reflects the one developed during the analysis phase.
